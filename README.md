# Head of software engineering

This repository is to collect and organise my ideas and resources in my journey becoming head of software engineering at NICE Digital.  


# Principles

Below are some principles that i've laid out to guide my efforts.

## Use data to make decisions
I am to gather insights and do research to help test my assumptions before committing to doing work.   This is to help me better add value by prioritising work effectively.  This can be anything from delivery work to personal improvement.


## Manage the system, not the people
Software leadership isn't about command and control style management.  Being a 'servant leader' is a much more effective way of helping organisations to get stuff done through a facilitating style of leadership.  The key to sustainable positive organisational change is to manage the system that people work in, not the people themselves.  This allows for some degree of flexibility and adaptability in the context of complex organisational systems.

## Stay connected to delivery work
As a head of discipline, its important to still understand the problems and challenges facing the members of the discipline in order to provide leadership and support.  This means working where possible with other developers to understand the challenges demanded by software delivery work in the delivery teams.
