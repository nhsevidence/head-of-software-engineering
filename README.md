# Head of software engineering

This repository is to collect and organise my ideas and resources in my journey becoming head of software engineering at NICE Digital.  This is for anyone at NICE Digital to look at (and challenge) and also to be shared publically for anyone who may be following a similar journey or just has an interest. 


# Principles

Below are some principles that i've laid out to guide my efforts in developing the engineering team at NICE Digital.

## Use data to make decisions
Using data and insights to make decisions helps to prioritise work effectively.  This applies to everything from technical engineering work to community of practice and skill development.  

## Manage the system, not the people
Traditional command and control style management and leadership isn't very effective in a complex software development environment.    Being a 'servant leader' better helps to support the teams to solve their own problems through a more facilitating style of leadership that recognises the expertise of the team.  The key to sustainable positive organisational change is to manage the system that people work in, not by managing the people themselves.  

## Stay technical
As a head of discipline, its important to still understand the problems and challenges facing developers in order to provide leadership and support.  This means working where possible with other developers to understand the challenges demanded by software delivery work in the delivery teams.   

## Develop skill
Proactively look to sponsor others for skill development opportunities.  Get your junior developers to do significant project work or feature development.  Let the learner lead and not the expert.  Growing capability often requires slowing down sometimes and this needs communicating and defending. 

## Make things fun
Work doesn't have to be boring.  A little extra thought is all thats required to add a fun twist to most things. Simple things like adding a picture here or their to meeting invites, or a humourous description or theme for something can make all the difference.  This can help to boost engagement.



# Gathering insights

It's important to gather insights to inform where to focus efforts. Here are a few ways of gathering insights

## Do user research
Speak to developers.  Ask them questions about top priorities to focus on.  Make it clear that you are approachable and want to help.  Do this privately in a space that's safe to talk.  Ask open questions and use active listening.  

## Do a developer survey
Depending on the size of your organisation, a [developer survey](Developer-survey.md) might be useful.
