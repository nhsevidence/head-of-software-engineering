# Head of software engineering

This repository is to collect and organise my ideas and resources in my journey becoming head of software engineering at NICE Digital.  This is for anyone at NICE Digital to look at (and challenge) and also to be shared publically for anyone who may be following a similar journey or just has an interest. 


# Principles

Below are some principles that i've laid out to guide my efforts in developing the engineering team at NICE Digital.

## Use data to make decisions
I aim to gather insights and do research to help test my assumptions before committing to doing work.   This is to help me better add value by prioritising work effectively.  This can be anything from delivery work to community of practice or personal improvement.

## Manage the system, not the people
Traditional 'command and control' style management and leadership isn't effective in a complex software development environment.  Being a 'servant leader' better helps to support the team and organisation to get stuff done through a more facilitating style of leadership that recognises the expertise of the team in solving their own problems.  The key to sustainable positive organisational change is to manage the system that people work in, not by managing the people themselves.  

## Stay connected to delivery work
As a head of discipline, its important to still understand the problems and challenges facing the members of the discipline in order to provide leadership and support.  This means working where possible with other developers to understand the challenges demanded by software delivery work in the delivery teams.   

## Make things fun
Work doesn't have to be boring.  A little extra thought is all thats required to add a fun twist to most things. Simple things like adding a picture here or their to meeting invites, or a humourous description or theme for something can make all the difference.  This can help to boost engagement.
